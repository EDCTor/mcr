	<b>Description:</b> MERP Critical Resolver (MCR) is an online application for automating the 
	monotony of resolving MERP attacks using the charts from the main book/combat screen.<br/><br/>
	 
	<b>What MCR does not do:</b> MCR does not track item bonuses, special bonuses, or preparation bonuses.<br/><br/>
	
	<b>How to use MCR:</b> The PC should make an OB roll, add any relevant bonuses (item bonuses, 
	special bonuses, preparation bonus) and give the modified number to the GM.  The GM should then
	enter the number into the Primary roll page.<br/><br/>
	
	Secondary Critical roll is resolved automatically.  Meaning that the PC makes a critical roll and
	the GM enters that roll into the Secondary Critical lookup unmodified.  The MCR does automatically
	track the bonus from the primary attack.<br/><br/>
	
	Fumbles are not currently resolved in MCR and should be done manually.<br/><br/>
